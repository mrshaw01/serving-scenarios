# Scenarios Folder Structure

This folder contains numbered scenario directories.

```text
scenarios/
├── README.md
├── 00_long_document_chat/
├── 01_<scenario_name>/
└── 02_<scenario_name>/
```

Conventions:

- Each scenario has its own folder.
- Use numeric prefixes (`00_`, `01_`, `02_`) to keep execution order clear.
- Each scenario folder should include its own `README.md` with details for that scenario.
